I have <br /> worked in many different industries, companies, and geographies, and the value I <br />bring is that I can think differently about problem-solving than most. <br />I have gone through the full spectrum of product management, from b2c/b2b, e- <br />commerce to health tech, playing IC and manager roles, and I am comfortable playing <br /> the part that is needed to get a product to be successful.</p>
